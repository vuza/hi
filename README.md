It is a P2P WebRTC videochat. A webclient connects to another webclient through WebRTC, while a server takes care of the client's handshake.

## Run application
Simply type ```npm install``` if not installed yet and ```npm start``` to start the application. Make sure a webserver (I recommend nginx) points to the public folder, to serve static files.
